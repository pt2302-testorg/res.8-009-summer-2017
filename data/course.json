  "course_description": "*Introduction to Oscillations and Waves* covers the basic mathematics and physics of oscillatory and wave phenomena. By the end of the course, students should be able to explain why oscillations appear in many near equilibrium systems, the various mathematical properties of those oscillations in various contexts, how oscillations and waves are related, and the basic mathematical description and properties of a wave.\n\nThis course was offered as part of [MITES Summer](https://mites.mit.edu/discover-mites/mites-summer/), a six-week, residential STEM experience for rising high school seniors. [MIT Introduction to Technology, Engineering, and Science (MITES)](https://mites.mit.edu/) provides transformative experiences that bolster confidence, create lifelong community, and build an exciting, challenging foundation in STEM for highly motivated 7th\u201312th grade students from diverse and underrepresented backgrounds.",
