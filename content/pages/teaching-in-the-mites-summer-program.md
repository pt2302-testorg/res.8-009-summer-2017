*In this section, Dr. Mobolaji Williams sums up his experience teaching physics classes in the MITES summer program.*

Teaching in MITES was like teaching on "easy mode." All of the students were very motivated, and thus they brought theirÂ entire selves to the task of learning advanced material. I would recommend the program to both students and instructors alike! It would also be great if the structure of MITES could be replicated throughout the country. I think it would create a positive feedback loop of benefits for many years.
