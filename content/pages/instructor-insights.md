## Instructor Interview

In the pages linked below, Dr. Mobolaji Williams describes various aspects of how he taught the MITES summer courses *Introduction to Oscillations and Waves* in 2017 and *Introduction to Statistical Physics* in 2018.

## Curriculum Information

### Prerequisites

With regard to mathematics, students should be proficient in algebra, matrix addition/multiplication, trigonometry, analytic geometry, and basic differentiation/integration. With regard to physics, students should have had prior exposure to and practice with Newton’s laws of motion, 1D kinematics, 2D projectile motion, and conservation of energy/momentum.

### Requirements Satisfied

Students in the MITES summer program take one physics course in addition to courses in life science, calculus, humanities, and engineering. *Introduction to Oscillations and Waves* is one of the courses that meet the program's physics requirement.

### Offered

Occasionally

## Assessment

There are no formal grades in the MITES summer program, but students do receive numerical grades on their assignments and exams so that they and the instructors can track their progress. 

## Student Information

Students in the MITES summer program are placed into one of three tiers of physics classes based on their prior experience in the subject. Those who have never taken physics usually take Physics I. Those who have some exposure to physics (e.g., one class in basic mechanics) usually take Physics II. Students who have had substantial exposure to physics (e.g., multiple physics classes) and who also know calculus take Physics III. During the 2017 session, Physics III was *Introduction to Oscillations and Waves*.

## How Student Time Was Spent

During an average week, students were expected to spend 12 hours on the course, roughly divided as follows:

### Lectures

- Met twice per week for 1.5 hours per session; 12 sessions total; mandatory attendance.

### Recitations

- Met once per week for 1 hour per session; mandatory attendance.
- In recitations, the teaching assistant fielded questions from students and helped them work through sample problems.

### Out of Class

- Outside of class, students completed weekly problem sets and studied for the midterm and final exam.
